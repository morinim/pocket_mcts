## Overview

A minimal implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in C++17.

---

MCTS is one of the machine learning techniques at the heart of AlphaGo/Zero, the first computer program to beat the world champion in a game of Go.

Itâ€™s elegant and easy to understand, can be used with little or no domain knowledge, and has succeeded on difficult problems (not only in the game area).

## Setting up the build

```shell
mkdir -p build
cd build/
cmake ..
```

To suggest a specific compiler you can write:

```shell
CXX=clang++ cmake ..
```

You're now ready to build using the traditional `make` system. All the output files will be stored in the `build/` directory (out of source build).
